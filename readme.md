# DPS  
* [Granblue Fantasy](http://game.granbluefantasy.jp) Combat Tracker Extension based on the defunct Viramate's one. All credit to its developper.  
#### Difference  
* Read-Only, doesn't modify any game code. It just reads your network traffic in battle.  
* Include lot of fixes and upgrades over the vanilla version.  
#### Installation  
* Go to the Chrome Extension Menu at `chrome://extensions` and enable `Developper Mode` on the top right.  
* Click on `Load Unpacked` and select the extension folder.  
* The extension is ready to use.  
#### Usage  
* Open Chrome Developper Tools with the `F12` key.  
* A new tab called `Combat Tracker` should be visible.  
#### Known Issues  
* Because it doesn't rely on Viramate or any similar extension, it can only check for your Party composition when loading a fight.  
* Multi-hit skill criticals aren't working
